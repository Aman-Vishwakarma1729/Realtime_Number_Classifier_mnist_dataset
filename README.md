# Real-Time Number Prediction from Camera using CNN


## Introduction

This project demonstrates a real-time digit prediction system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. By utilizing computer vision techniques and deep learning, the project captures video frames from a camera feed and predicts the digit shown in real time.

## Features

- Real-time digit recognition from camera feed.
- Utilizes a trained CNN model for accurate predictions.
- Seamless integration of TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Numpy.
- Easy-to-use script for capturing and predicting digits.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

1. Train the CNN model:

    Open the Jupyter notebook `CNN_LENET_Model_for_mnist_dataset.ipynb` and run the cells to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The trained model weights will be saved for later use.

2. Run the real-time prediction:

    Execute the scripts to start the real-time digit prediction from the camera feed:

3. Exit the prediction window:

    Press `q` to exit the camera feed window.
